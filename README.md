# Purpose
Nowadays, it is desirable for any public or private entity with an educational or formative vocation to adhere to the new formula of delivering their courses that would allow that institution to put their contents online to overcome the problems of congestion within their classes  and extend their geographical scope anyone who is interested around the world can take their course. 
I designed this application to help me to share my skills online and help anyone on market who want to share their skills and make a profit from it. This application will help any content creator or any school to upload online a course where anyone can buy it or stream it for free if is uploaded as a free course. This app will hold courses about different topic / subject. Different users can buy and after they will be able to review that course they bought. User can also upload a course, upgrade it, or retire it. A user who uploaded a course can see a report of all copies sold and cash out or keep it in app balance where they can use that balance to buy other courses
